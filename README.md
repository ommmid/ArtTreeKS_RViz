# arttreeks_rviz
The output of [ArtTreeKS](https://github.com/bobbens/ArtTreeKS) is a robot defined by the joint axes in the reference position. This repository visualizes this robot in RViz so that the designer can make sure that the result of kinematics synthesis is acceptable. Moreover, the robot can be tested for implementing sensors and examined for interaction with the environment. This package helps the robot designers to reach the best possible structure for their robots.
